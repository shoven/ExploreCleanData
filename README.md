This directory contains a file - run_analytis.R.
The end result of the file is to create a tidy dataset - "data_set_with_the_averages.txt"
run_analysis has code written in 5 steps and all the steps are documented in the code file.
The logic of the file is a  follows:
# 1 merge the training set and test set
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
# 5. Creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
