This directory contains a file - run_analytis.R. The end result of the file is to create a tidy dataset - "data_set_with_the_averages.txt" run_analysis has code written in 5 steps and all the steps are documented in the code file. The logic of the file is a follows:
The logic of the program is as follows: 
1 merge the training set and test set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The result is a 10299x66 data frame, because only 66 out of 561 attributes are measurements on the mean and standard deviation. All measurements appear to be floating point numbers in the range (-1, 1).
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
6. Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
7. Creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
